# NAGE
NAGE: Not A Good Engine. Written by two first year university students. Hence the title.

## Current features
  * It draws a rectangle
  
## Planned features
  * 2D top-down tile-based perspective.
  * DnD-inspired random number generator.
  * Trivial development for the budding game developer.

### Dependencies
  * SFML 2.4.2 (32-bit) - make sure you have the static libs.
  * A recent version of Visual Studio (we're using 2017, but 2015 and earlier should work fine)

### Building on Visual Studio
  * Clone the project however you desire (using GitHub for Visual Studio is the easiest way)
  * Open the solution within the NAGE folder.
  * In the Properties window for the project, add the includes `(C++ / General)` and additional libraries `(Linker / General)` directories for your installation of SFML.
  * Press F5 and cross your fingers.
